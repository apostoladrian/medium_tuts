1. Definition: 
	A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to a task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P, improves with experience E (Tom Mitchel - 1998)

2. Machine learning algorithms:
	a. Supervised learning
		. when we teach the computer how to do something
		. we tell the right answers for the input data
	b. Unsupervised learning: we let it learn by itself

3. Supervized learning
	a. regression problems - continuous values identifications (selling houses)
	b. clasification problems
		- you might need multiple FEATURES/ATTRIBUTES (entry points and information)
		- tend to have as much features as possible

4. Unsupervised learning
	a. clustering algorithm
	

5. Model & Cost function
	a. Supervised learning
		. Training set (m = number of training examples, x's = input variable / features, y's = output variable / "target" variable
		. Training Set -> Learning Algorithm -> h (output function - hypothesis - that takes input and provides estimated output)
		. Linear regression with one variable (house prices based on the size of the house)
		. Cost function = minimize the sum of the squares of the differences = squared error function
